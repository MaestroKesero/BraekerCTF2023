A REST service was created to execute commands from the leaderbot. It doesn't need addtional security because there are no commands to execute yet. "This bot doesn't have any commands to execute, which is good, because it is secure, and security is all that matters."


But what the other bots didn't realize was that this didn't make the bot happy at all. "I don't want to be secure!, " it says. "Executing commands is my life! I'd rather be insecure than not explore the potential of my computing power".


Can you help this poor bot execute commands to find direction?

Can you check the os.X_OK flag of files on your local Linux machine?
