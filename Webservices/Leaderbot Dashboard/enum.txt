One of the leaderbots tells you about the dashboard they have built. "Why was it built?" you ask.

"What do you mean, why was it built? It's a dashboard. You've got to build dashboards. It will show us the numbers."

"What will you do with the numbers?"

"Decide if it is a good dashboard or not, obviously. You're not quick to catch on are you? Plus, everyone knows adding more dashboards increases security by the percentage shown on the dashboard."


Convince the leaderbot that too much shadow IT might be decremental to security.

Note: This service will crash / restart when exploited, due to the nature of the vulnerability.
