I used https://github.com/spipm/Depix (CTF organizer!) to reverse the four pixelated MD5 digests using snippets from the provided screenshot; follow instructions in the repository. The resulting digest images are not perfect, but the number of characters that are imperfect are small so you can create a list of digests with all possibilities. Rest is cracking them with `rockyou.txt` wordlist as in description. Note hashcat has maximum size of 256 characters for MD5 input, so you can not use hashcat I think. I encountered this problem when using combinator attack mode and hashcat showed me the digest was cracked but I never managed to get the right-hand side of the combinator attack wordlist out of it (why does hashcat not pop some warning message for this?!). Cracking in Python worked.
