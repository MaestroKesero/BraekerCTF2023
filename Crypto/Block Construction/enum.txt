"Sir, sir! This is a construction site." You look up at what you thought was a building being constructed, but you realize it is a construction bot. "Sir please move aside. I had to have these blocks in order since last week, but some newbie construction bot shuffled them." "I can move aside, " you tell the bot, "but I might be able to help you out."


Can you help the bot get the blocks in order?
